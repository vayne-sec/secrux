## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

- Prefer: GitHub Security Advisory (repository → Security → Advisories)
- If advisories are not available, contact the maintainers privately

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the impact
- Reproduction steps / PoC (if possible)
- Affected versions / commit SHA
